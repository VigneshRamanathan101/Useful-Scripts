1. Youtube playlist transfer script
- This script help move youtube videos from one account to another.
- IF you are like me and you like to create a playlist of your fav content creator and copy it from someone else and edit it in your account, and not a fan of 3rd party apps accessing your account you can use this.
- This script uses Google youtube API key of recipient account adn the source youtube playlist url and reads from source and writes to destination account as a playlist.
